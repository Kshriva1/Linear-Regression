# Linear-Regression

We have a contract with an E-commerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. 
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
We use linear regression to figure this out.
This project uses fake data from the [Ecommerce Customers](https://github.com/Kshriva1/Linear-Regression/blob/master/Ecommerce%20Customers)
